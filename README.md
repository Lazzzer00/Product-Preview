# Product-Preview
This is my solution to the "Product Preview" from Frontend mentor using Hyper Text Markup Language and Cascading Style Sheets.
This challenge was fairly simple. 
Using flexbox on the body I was able to center the element in middle of the screen.
In the media queries I added display flex on the main. That made the picture and the text into columns which we needed.
The picture element made the picture change.
If you notice anything that could be improved and optimized, text me!
Thx!
